title: 'Connectors – All Silver-plated'
description: |-
  Speakers
  Terminations include robust, twin-screw, Ag-plated spades, as well as appropriate compact or extra-large bananas. Standard construction of AgPur cables incorporates both spades and bananas.

  Interconnects
  1.	XLR
  Harmonie is terminated with Neutrik Pro Ag locking connectors.
  Athène and Heracles use an Ag-plated fluorocarbon dielectric premium XLR. Locking Neutriks are a no-cost substitution for pro or studio use. 
  2.	RCA
  Single-ended AgPUR interconnecting cables use a minimal mass RCA plug made of silver-plated tellurium/copper contacts. This design preserves an all Ag conductor path, providing total signal coherence.
