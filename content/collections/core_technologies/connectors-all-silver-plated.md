title: 'Connectors – All Silver-plated'
description: |-
  Speakers
  Terminations include very robust, twin-screw, Ag-plated dual-orifice spades, as well as appropriate high-friction compact or looser extra-large bananas. Standard 2.5M stock construction of AgPur Cables incorporates BOTH spades and bananas.

  Interconnects:	XLR
  Harmonie is terminated with Neutrik Pro Ag locking connectors.
  Athène and Heracles use an Ag-plated fluorocarbon dielectric premium XLR. Locking Neutriks are a no-cost substitution for Pro or studio use. 
  	RCA
  Single-ended AgPUR interconnecting cables use a minimal mass RCA plug comprising silver-plated tellurium/copper contacts. This design preserves an all Ag conductor path, providing total signal coherence. Alternatively, locking WBT 0152Ag are available for Pro or studio use.
