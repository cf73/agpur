title: 'Connectors – All Silver-plated'
description: |-
  Speakers
  Terminations include very robust, twin-screw, Ag-plated dual-orifice spades, as well as appropriate high-friction compact or looser extra-large bananas. Standard 2.5M stock construction of AgPur Cables incorporates BOTH spades and bananas. Any permutation easily accommodated.

  Interconnects:	XLR
  Harmonie is terminated with Neutrik Pro Ag locking connectors.
  Athène and Heracles use an Ag-plated fluorocarbon dielectric premium XLR. Locking Neutriks are a no-cost substitution for Pro or studio use. 
  	RCA
  Single-ended AgPUR interconnecting cables use a minimal mass RCA plug comprising silver-plated tellurium/copper contacts. This design preserves an all Ag conductor path, providing total signal coherence. Alternatively, locking WBT 0152Ag are available for Pro or studio use.

  Power Cables 
  All use premium silver-plated heavy contacts with unique balanced-geometry twin screw-traps to assure very tight connections with maximum possible current delivery.
