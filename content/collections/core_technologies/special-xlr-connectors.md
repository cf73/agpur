title: 'Solid Ag Strands'
description: |-
  AgPur’s cable cores consist of arrays of variable strands, arranged in accordance with the Golden Mean ratio. Each hand-polished silver strand sits in its own voluminous air-cushion within a fluorocarbon barrier.

  This purely holistic strand arrangement ensures optimal performance by eliminating cross-strand effects and ensuring low capacitance.

  AgPur thus provides a complete 100% silver pathway, using only roomy Teflon  ”air-tubes” as minimalist dielectrics.

  No PVC, PE, other plastics, textiles or foams are used.
