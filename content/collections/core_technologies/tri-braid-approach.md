title: 'Interconnect Conductor Mass'
description: 'Unlike many other “pure” silver interconnects, that only  offer 19-24 AWG, thus reducing signal conductivity, silver mass in  AGPur starts at 19 AWG in its Harmonie model, increasing to 18 AWG in the higher resolution Athène, culminating in an unheard of 16 AWG in the peerless Heracles providing extremely low series resistance.'
