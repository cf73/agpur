description: |-
  All individual Ag strand cores are initially arranged as inner twisted pairs, followed by aggregation of spirals and star-quads to limit mutual inductance. The exterior geometry of these strands consists of twisted pairs (AGPur speaker) or tri-braids (ICs).

  AgPur single-ended (RCA) ICs follow a geometric noise-cancelling tri-braid geometry that results in a purer performance than shielded constructions. Outer shields may be added for especially noisy environments.
