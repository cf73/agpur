description: |-
  ArgentPur's solid Ag strand cores are initially arranged as inner twisted pairs, followed by aggregation of spirals and star-quads to lower mutual inductance and capacitance. The final exterior geometry of these strands consists of twisted pairs (AGPur Speaker) or tri-braids (Interconnects).

  AgPur single-ended (RCA) ICs also follow this geometric noise-cancelling tri-braid external geometry that results in a purer musical performance than shielded constructions. Remote outer shields may be added for especially noisy environments by the end user.
