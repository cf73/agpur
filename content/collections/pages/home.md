        text: 'Pure silver (Ag) has a 106% conductivity compared to the maximum theoretical transmission of copper at a technically defined 100%. So even umpteen-nines Cu can''t remotely approach pure silver. The market is flooded with silver plated copper conductors. To many, these have compromised qualities that limit top octave clarity, coherence, and may lead some to describe them as "bright" or having "glare". Pure silver has no such compromises, and indeed has NO SOUND of its own.'

        text: 'In order of preference, the available media for the Ag conductors to rest within are: a vacuum (rather impractical), air, and then the low dielectric involvement insulative barriers when necessary. The best of these is arguably the fluorocarbon groups.'

        text: "To minimize dielectric effect further, each individual\_ Ag strand used in ArgentPur is manually threaded through its own fluorocarbon tube that is 5-10x larger in size so that contact between the Ag conductor and its protective carrier is dramatically reduced indeed.\_ Capacitance and inductance are thus minimized, with no \"signal-hopping\" destructive interference across the frequency spectra."
