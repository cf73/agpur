    title: 'Solid Ag Strands'
    text: "AgPur’s cable cores consist of arrays of variable strands, arranged in accordance with the Golden Mean ratio. Each hand-polished silver strand sits in its own voluminous air-cushion within a fluorocarbon barrier to provide vanishingly low dielectric interference.\LThis purely holistic strand arrangement ensures optimal performance by also eliminating cross-strand effects whilst ensuring low capacitance.\LAgPur thus provides a complete 100% silver pathway, using only roomy Teflon  ”air-tubes” as physical barriers.\L\LNo PVC, PE, other plastics, textiles or foams are used!"

    title: 'Interconnect Conductor Mass'
    text: 'Unlike many other “pure” silver interconnects that only offer 19-24AWG total conductor mass, thus possibly reducing signal current, silver mass in AGPur starts at 19 AWG in its Harmonie model, increasing to 18 AWG in the higher resolution Athène, culminating in an unheard of 16 AWG in the peerless Heracles, providing extremely low series resistance and huge bass slam!'

    title: 'Variable Strands'
    text: |-
      Multiple pairs of solid Ag strands, scaled by the Golden Ratio (1.618), combine to provide a naturally balanced musical portrayal through all octaves... with unmatched air, top octave resolution, and exquisitely detailed stage imagery.

       XLR Harmonie is terminated with Neutrik Pro Ag locking connectors. Athène and Heracles use an Ag-plated fluorocarbon dielectric premium XLR. Locking Neutriks are a no-cost substitution for Pro or studio use. 
      RCA Single-ended AgPur Interconnecting Cables use a minimal mass RCA plug comprising silver-plated tellurium/copper contacts. This design preserves an all Ag conductor path, providing total signal coherence. Alternatively, locking WBT 0152Ag are available for Pro or studio use.
