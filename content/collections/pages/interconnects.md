    title: 'Solid Ag Strands'
    text: "AgPur’s cable cores consist of arrays of variable strands, arranged in accordance with the Golden Mean ratio. Each hand-polished silver strand sits in its own voluminous air-cushion within a fluorocarbon barrier to provide vanishingly low dielectric interference.\LThis purely holistic strand arrangement ensures optimal performance by also eliminating cross-strand effects whilst ensuring low capacitance.\LAgPur thus provides a complete 100% silver pathway, using only roomy Teflon  ”air-tubes” as physical barriers.\L\LNo PVC, PE, other plastics, textiles or foams are used!"

    title: 'Interconnect Conductor Mass'
    text: 'Unlike many other “pure” silver interconnects that only offer 19-24AWG total conductor mass, thus possibly reducing signal current, silver mass in AGPur starts at 19 AWG in its Harmonie model, increasing to 18 AWG in the higher resolution Athène, culminating in an unheard of 16 AWG in the peerless Heracles, providing extremely low series resistance and huge bass slam!'
