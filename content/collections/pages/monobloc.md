This best practice effects a lower total cost,\_especially if short power cables can be sent from your room's sidewalls.  (Note: If long RCAs are required, custom-length SHIELDED AgPur RCAss are available for use to control single-ended noise issues.)"

        text: "But if you already have established, or prefer, a more traditional central rack components geometry using short ICs and longer speaker cables, you'll find the DUO version easier to implement, and requiring only one power cable. This setup may be true also if you use one central power conditioner and prefer not to send long power cables to separate speaker-area monos. See our new PowerBox as a possibly helpful Ag power cable."
