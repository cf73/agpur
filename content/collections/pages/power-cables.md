        text: 'Power Cables consist of matrices of twisted pairs of solid pure Ag strands individually threaded through their own air-cushioned fluorocarbon tubes... just as all AgPur products. Stock sizes are 1.5M, terminated with Viborg 503S Ag plug. Experience suggests that an all-AgPur power cord family preserves utmost transparency.'
