    title: 'Connectors – All Silver-plated'
    text: 'Speakers Terminations include very robust, twin-screw, Ag-plated dual-orifice spades, as well as appropriate high-friction compact or looser extra-large Ag bananas. Standard 2.5M stock construction of AgPur Cables incorporates BOTH spades and bananas. Interconnects: XLR Harmonie is terminated with Neutrik Pro Ag locking connectors. Athène and Heracles use an Ag-plated fluorocarbon dielectric premium XLR. Locking Neutriks are a no-cost substitution for Pro or studio use. RCA Single-ended AgPUR interconnecting cables use a minimal mass RCA plug comprising silver-plated tellurium/copper contacts. This design preserves an all Ag conductor path, providing total signal coherence. Alternatively, locking WBT 0152Ag are available for Pro or studio use.'

    title: 'Solid Ag Strands'
    text: |-
      AgPur’s cable cores consist of arrays of variable strands, arranged in accordance with the Golden Mean ratio. Each hand-polished silver strand sits in its own voluminous air-cushion within a fluorocarbon barrier to provide vanishingly low dielectric interference.
      This purely holistic strand arrangement ensures optimal performance by also eliminating cross-strand effects whilst ensuring low capacitance.
      AgPur thus provides a complete 100% silver pathway, using only roomy Teflon ”air-tubes” as physical barriers.
      No PVC, PE, other plastics, textiles or foams are used!
