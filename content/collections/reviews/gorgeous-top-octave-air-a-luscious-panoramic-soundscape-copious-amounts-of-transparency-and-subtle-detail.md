review_excerpt: |-
  The usual adjectives and more to describe the sound qualities of these amplifiers can be applied; and then some. There is little or no coloration to the sound while the balance is supreme and superb, with no “flavor” to the quality of the sound. You will notice that the better the program sources you use with these amps, the more “natural” and beautiful sounding they will become.
  A silky smooth, extravagantly powered match to any speaker system, and filled with air, ambiance, a lovely textured midrange, and a fine detailed treble response.
