review_excerpt: |-
  Unlike nearly every other GaN amp out there, especially monoblocks, the Argent Pur monos are built fantastically and look even better. ...
  There is just so much to like about Gan-FET amps, and these take an audiophileâ€™s highly detailed, even obsessive approach to the design. Every possible design element was up for discussion and likely addressed in these new-school audiophile amps.
