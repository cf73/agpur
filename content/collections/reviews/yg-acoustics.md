  "These cables are spectacular. The first in were speaker cables.... Compared to the Cardas (Clear Beyond) in our room, I noticed the "s" sounds in recordings sound more lifelike.... Bass was the same, maybe a little better.... But when I added the XLRs, everything got way more pinpoint precise, the soundstage became well defined throughout and grew, and the bass became thunderous--to the extent that I had to drop the subwoofer volume and bass EQ contour. Wow!
  The real icing on the cake was adding the Power Cables to the DAC first and then the Innuous Statement streamer: just incredible...especially the server cable. Instant layers and depth and vibrant emotion. Wow!
  We really love them." Duncan Taylor, YG Acoustics
