title: Flyovers
description: 'ArgentPur226 Flyovers provide a very affordable taste of the finest twisted pairs of solid, pure Ag used in all formulations, conveniently terminated in bananas. When overlaid onto existing high-performance cables (especially all-copper), they usually add soundstage air and detail to an already acceptable presentation...especially with reference-level components upstream and superlative software files and/or superb vinyl.'
