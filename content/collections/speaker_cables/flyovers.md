  AgPur226 Flyovers provide a very affordable taste of the finest twisted pairs of solid, pure Ag used in all ArgentPur formulations, conveniently terminated in bananas. When overlaid onto existing high-performance cables (especially all-copper), they usually add soundstage air and detail to an already acceptable presentation...especially with reference-level components upstream and superlative software files and/or superb vinyl.

  Note that Flyovers are not band-aids for systemic flaws, nor tone controls that eliminate existing problems in the treble octaves due to silver-plated conductors, low-res files or lesser tweeters, for example. Achieving a completely holistic musical presentation across all octaves is then achieved with a complete AgPur Speaker Cable as the next magical step. Flyovers offer a taste of pure silver frosting before eating the cake!
