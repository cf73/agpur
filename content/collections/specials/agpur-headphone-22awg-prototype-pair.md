title: 'AgPur HEADPHONE 22AWG PROTOTYPE pair'
type_of_special: headphone-cable
description: |-
  PROTOTYPE pair made for OEM. 22AWG Phenomenal performance, but wanted cheaper non-Ag version.
  1/4" plug and 3.5mm plugs...so you'll need adaptors? Pic available upon request. 22AWG is more than competitive cables, but if you have VERY heavy current needs from your low impedance/sens cans see the mating 19AWG version.
original_price: 1500
price: 750
