description: 'Prototype pair of high-current 19AWG headphone cables. 1.2M (4ft), with 1/4" plug and 3.5mm plug ends. Built for OEM demo...who LOVED them. But I decided to avoid the tedious mess of connector options.  I made a 3M version as an extension cable for my Meze Elites, and can hear NO insertion delta. Cool.  Pic on request.'
