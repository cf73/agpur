type_of_special: speaker-cable
description: |-
  Prototype pair of 1.2M (4ft) 22AWG headphone cables (1/4" + 3.5mm plugs) for OEM. Performance is superb.  I may simply decide to not make more as the forest of headphone connectors is onerous.
  Perfect for medium-high sens phones. See listing for double-current 19AWG PROTOTYPE for low sens/impedance cans.
