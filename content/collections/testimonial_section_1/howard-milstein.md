        text: '"...sounding as good as anything on the market.... I still can''t believe it is so.... Your pricing for the gauge that I have (AgPur12, $6k 2.5M) is quite amazing compared to other high end companies! It is perfect with a smooth ambient effect and much detail and huge soundstaging. Nothing ever SHOUTS AT YOU...they are that musical!!"'
