  "...they're a phenomenal duo. Better than TQS (TelleriumQ Statement) by some distance...not a subtle thing... a massive difference."

  "The Heracles (RCA) explodes out into the room and hangs in the air around you....(they) are in another league."

  "...on the analogue (vinyl) they sounded like master tape."

  "...easiest A/B test (with TQS) I've ever done. These are far and away transcendentally better than anything I've ever heard."

  "These reset the yardstick, and do so with a knowing smirk and a wink...they're masterful."
