  "There is something extraordinary going on here and amazingly beautiful in the initial trials. Could it be magic?"
  "I'd say it's the only silver... cable I have heard that outranks the most expensive all-copper I have ever heard!"
  "...sounding as good as anything on the market.... I still can't believe it is so.... Your pricing for the gauge that I have (AgPur12, $6k 2.5M) is quite amazing compared to other high end companies! It is perfect with a smooth ambient effect and much detail and huge soundstaging. Nothing ever SHOUTS AT YOU...they are that musical!!"
