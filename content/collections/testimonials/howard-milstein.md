  "There is something extraordinary going on here and amazingly beautiful in the initial trials. Could it be magic?"
  "The piano is the hardest to reproduce faithfully, but these cables have done an excellent job so far...I was a bit shocked to hear such reverbera(tion) on the Benjamin Britten ECO strings, that heretofore were a bit lively and shouty...this told me something special was going on with these cables..."
  "I'd say it's the only silver... cable I have heard that outranks the most expensive all-copper I have ever heard!"
  "These cables seem to work with my amplification and speakers like nothing I have heard before, and that's saying something for ANY TYPE OF CABLE!"
  "...sounding as good as anything on the market.... I still can't believe it is so...and that goes for almost every other cable I have tried. (My past reviews have a subtle disdain for silver-plated copper.) Your pricing for the gauge that I have (AgPur12, $6k 2.5M) is quite amazing compared to other high end companies! I'm enjoying this cable more than anything I have in a long while...it is perfect in the upper mid-high frequencies at this point in my evaluation(,) with a smooth ambient effect and much detail and huge soundstaging. Nothing ever SHOUTS AT YOU...they are that musical!!"
