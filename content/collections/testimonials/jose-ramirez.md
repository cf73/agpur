  Jose: "These are very very good. I'm going to wire my three rooms at Capfest with them."

  Conrad: "...they're a phenomenal duo. Better than TQS (TelleriumQ Statement) by some distance...not a subtle thing, (but) a massive difference."
  "The Heracles (RCA) explodes out into the room and hangs in the air around you."
  "...stringed instruments sound rosined and rich; female vocals have weight rather than floating away; they're very nice indeed. (They) are in another league."
  "...the system (all Einstein) has never sounded this good, and I don't know if I've ever heard better anywhere at this point."
  "...you can hear so deep into the mix that it surely goes beyond what any (record) producer ever intended."
  "I switched over to (my) Harbeth P3/FLD system....Both of your (cables) absolutely transformed that system: things sounded far more velvety, lush, detailed, refined, real, sophisticated...a joy to listen to."
  "...the (ArgentPur) were leagues better--much more refined, more revealing, an absolutely intoxicating listen even on this humble (desktop) system."
  "...peerless... detail, size...where all strengths come through in spades (monster dynamics, 3D presentation, total transparency, etc."
  "...on the analogue (vinyl) they sounded like master tape."
  "...easiest A/B test (with TQS) I've ever done. These are far and away better...transcendentally better than anything I've ever heard. All the cliches apply: hearing things in the mix I never knew were there, layers of color and space and detail that never showed up before; like being in a room vs listening through a window."
  "These reset the yardstick, and do so with a knowing smirk and a wink...they're masterful. People pay $20k+ for this kind of upgrade."
  "It seems weird that the whole system doesn't leap off the rack and start dancing in the room--it feels so alive and "well"--as in totally healthy, (with) no trace of artificiality; just pure musicality and joy."
  "The (Heracles) has a ton more air, leading edge shgarpness (in a good way), are less warm and more neutral in tone/color cast, and sound bigger and even more transparent.":
