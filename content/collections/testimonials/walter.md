  "Uncolored, unfiltered, highly revealing of source material and room treatments."
  "To say that I am impressed is an understatement. The organic wholeness, the octave to octave balance, and the detailed yet extremely smooth top end was fantastic"
  "...the RCA cables: So far, so great! Nice bass extension couples with a huge soundstage."
